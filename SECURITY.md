# Security Policy

The Firefish team takes the security of our software and platform very seriously. We appreciate the efforts of security researchers and the community in helping us maintain a secure environment.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Firefish team and community welcome security reports and are grateful for your efforts to disclose vulnerabilities responsibly.

To ensure the confidentiality of your finding, **please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, we ask that you use GitHub's **Private Vulnerability Reporting** feature.

1. Go to the "Security" tab of our GitHub repository...
2. Click the "Report a vulnerability" button.
3. Please provide as much relevant information as possible, including:
   - A detailed description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue (including code snippets, if possible).
   - The potential impact of the vulnerability.
   - Any potential mitigations you might have considered.

### Our Commitment

If you report a vulnerability to us, we commit to the following:

- We will acknowledge receipt of your report in a timely manner.
- We will provide you with an estimated timeline for addressing the vulnerability.
- We will maintain an open line of communication with you throughout the process.
- We will notify you when the vulnerability has been fixed.

We believe in coordinating with security researchers to ensure that the fix is released before the vulnerability is publicly disclosed. We greatly appreciate your cooperation in making Firefish safer for everyone.

### Rewards

We believe in rewarding the valuable work of security researchers and ethical hackers who help us keep Firefish secure.

While we do not have a formal bug bounty program with fixed reward tiers at this time, we may offer a **discretionary monetary reward** for unique, severe, and high-quality vulnerability reports. The decision to grant a reward and its amount is at our sole discretion, based on the vulnerability's impact, severity, and the quality of the report provided.

We may also offer public recognition for your efforts.
